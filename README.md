# TBFG
A text based fighting game.



If the game does not boot, try running ``installer.bat``

Hi, I'm Stoflen, I am here to tell you about Enderman-brewer's game and why you should get it. Some things are still in beta and are unfinished. First we have:

## Playable charcters
This is not quite finished but here is his plan, every character will have it's own moveset. At the moment, while you can pick between 2 characters, they do the same moveset. Also...
# WHY WONT ENDERMAN-BREWER FINISH IT?! THIS WAS THE STATE IN THE LAST VERSION OF THIS GAME!

## Turn based
TBFG is completily turn based and in the console.

## Attack
Attack is a simple move where the character deals 1-100 damage, and if you get the crit, it automaticly turns 1-100 damage to 2-200 damage. After it's calcuated, it is directly put to the players health.

## Shield
Halves the other players damage until your next turn.

## AI
Enderman-brewer added a new gamemode, if you type ``VS AI`` during loading the game, you will be able to play with an AI, if you dont want to do that, you can also type ``VS friend``.
