# TBFG
A text based fighting game.

Hi, I'm Stoflen, I am here to tell you about enderman-brewer's game and why you should get it. Some things are still in beta and are unfinished. First we have:

## Playable charcters
-----
This is not quite finished but here is his plan, every character will have it's own moveset. At the moment, while you can pick between 2 characters, they do the same moveset.

## Turn based
-----
TBFG is completily turn based and in the console.
